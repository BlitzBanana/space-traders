# Space Traders 2

## Description

ST2 is not really a game, it's just an experiement.
My goal is to make a space game where there are some stations of different types around the space.
There are also some 'agents' who travel between stations to buy and sell some wares.
The goal is to script the best agent AI to get maximum benefits.
